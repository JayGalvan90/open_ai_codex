Building this application was done on javascript vanilla using vite, used Node.js for the server side. 
Made a responsive Layouts with CSS, handled events with javascript, making an API request, and render markdown from string.

 Select framework - vanilla 
3. pointing into client I called the command 'npm install ' which installed packages like package.json
4. created an account with openAI and took my own API key 
5. created a .env for the API key 
 Running ' npm run dev ' can run the script and show you a webpage.
